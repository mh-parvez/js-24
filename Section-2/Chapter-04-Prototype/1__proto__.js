
// @ In JavaScript, all objects have a hidden [[Prototype]] property that’s either another object or null.
// @ We can use obj.__proto__ to access it (a historical getter/setter, there are other ways, to be covered soon).
// @ The object referenced by [[Prototype]] is called a “prototype”.
// @ If we want to read a property of obj or call a method, and it doesn’t exist, then JavaScript tries to find it in the prototype.
// @ If we call obj.method(), and the method is taken from the prototype, this still references obj. So methods always work with the current object even if they are inherited.
// @ The for..in loop iterates over both its own and its inherited properties. All other key/value-getting methods only operate on the object itself.
